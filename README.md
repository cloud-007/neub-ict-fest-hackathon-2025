# Welcome to NEUB ICT Fest Hackathon 2025

## Introduction
Welcome to the **NEUB ICT Fest Hackathon 2025!**  
Your challenge is to bring innovation to a real-world public health problem — **automating the vaccination process for Bangladesh.**

You can use any technology stack or programming language that best supports your idea. You’ll be given a list of requirements to complete. You’re free to extend beyond them if you wish — but remember: **precision and quality outweigh feature count.**

## Judge Panel
- **Dr. Shafkat Kibria**, Associate Professor, [Leading University](https://www.lus.ac.bd)
- **Syed Rezwanul Haque**, Managing Director, [Technext Limited](https://technext.it/)
- **Abir Sadat Wasim**, Senior Software Engineer, [LiiLab](https://liilab.com)  
- **Md Mazharul Islam Emon**, Software Engineer L3, [LiiLab](https://liilab.com)

## The Challenge
Design and develop a **web or mobile-based solution** that automates the **end-to-end vaccination process** — from citizen registration and appointment scheduling to vaccine supply tracking and reporting.

Your system should serve three key stakeholders:
1. **Citizens** — who receive and verify vaccination services  
2. **Vaccination Centers** — that manage staff, vaccine stock, and appointments  
3. **Authorities** — who oversee distribution, monitor wastage, and analyze data  

---

## Real-World Context
The vaccination process in Bangladesh currently faces several challenges:
- Manual data entry leading to record mismatches  
- Difficulty maintaining accurate vaccine stock levels  
- Long queues and inefficient scheduling  
- Limited visibility of vaccine wastage and regional distribution  

Your mission is to propose a **digitally enhanced solution** that simplifies these processes and brings transparency to the vaccination ecosystem.

## What to Build
You can design one comprehensive system, or focus on one or more of these modules:

### Citizen Registration & Vaccine Card Digitization
- Collect NID/Birth Certificate information  
- Record vaccine type, dose, date, and center  
- Generate a digital vaccine card (QR-enabled)  
- Optional: Use OCR to extract data from paper vaccine cards  

### Appointment Management
- Allow citizens to book vaccination slots  
- Automated reminders via SMS or email  
- Dynamic scheduling to avoid overcrowding  

### Vaccination Centre Management
- Track vaccine stock, staff assignments, and daily capacity  
- Record used, remaining, and wasted doses  
- Vaccine preservation guideline  

### Supply Chain & Wastage Tracking
- Monitor vaccine movement between hubs and centers  
- Predict wastage using data trends or AI models  

### Admin Dashboard & Analytics
- Data visualization for coverage, demographics, and regions  
- Smart insights using automation or ML models  

---

## Bonus Ideas for AI & Automation
- **AI Chatbot** for FAQs and citizen guidance  
- **OCR** for automatic vaccine card data entry  
- **Forecasting** future demand using past usage data  
- **Anomaly Detection** to detect irregular stock reports  
- **Summarization** of daily or weekly reports  

---

## Development Requirements

### Mandatory Features
- Citizen registration and vaccination record system  
- Appointment scheduling module  
- Vaccine center dashboard  
- Authority/administrator view  
- Data storage with validation and secure access  

### Optional Enhancements
- QR-based digital vaccine card  
- AI chatbot for citizens  
- OCR-based data extraction  
- Predictive analytics for vaccine supply and wastage  
- Notifications and reminders system  
- Any new ideas are welcomed  

---

## How to Participate
1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account  
2. Create a new branch for each major feature (e.g., `feature/registration`)  
3. Complete each task and mark it as done in the checklist  
4. Commit and push your changes regularly  
5. Once done, submit your repository link and presentation to the judges  

---

## Deliverables
Each team must submit the following:
- **Working prototype/demo** (Web or Mobile App)  
- **README.md** describing:
  - The problem you addressed  
  - System architecture and technologies used  
  - Key features  
  - Use of AI or automation  
  - Future improvements  
- **Presentation and Q&A (15 Mins per Team)**  
  - Explain your problem, approach, and outcomes
